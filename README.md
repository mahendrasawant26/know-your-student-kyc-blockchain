# Document-Verification-Using-Blockchain
-----------------------------------------
## Abstract
Keeping track of and validating a big number of records is exceedingly difficult. As a
result, Tampering and the creation of bogus or duplicate certificates become an
unwelcome scenario. Certificates that are crucial to a person's character and skill set are
frequently the target of forgeries. It will take a lot of concentration and time to
distinguish between a fake certificate and an authentic certificate. Blockchain technology
can overcome this drawback because it cannot be altered under normal circumstances. If
the data is altered, it only takes a moment to alert us to the change. Blockchain only
considers data or a node to be valid when all relevant authorities concur. As a result, the
system would be authenticated and reliable at all times.

This project aims to create a blockchain based platform that allows a modern and
hassle-free solution to manage certificates, verify them and keep its integrity. The access
to upload the certificates will be reserved to the organizations issuing it and other
organizations can access and view the validated certificates easily. The entire process
works on the blockchain in partnership with the IPFS. It provides immutability and
publicly verifiable certificates, these Blockchain characteristics can be used to create
digital certificates that are resistant to counterfeiting.
